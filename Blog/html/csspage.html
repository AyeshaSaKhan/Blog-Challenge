                <strong>CSS1</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS 1 was adapted in 1996. It was difficult and less adapted by then recent browsers such as Internet Explorer 3, Internet Explorer 4 and Netscape 4.x.</li><br>
                    <li>CSS 1 had font properties and specification for typeface and emphasis. The text attributes were supported such as spacing of letters and line of text.</li><br>
                    <li> Alignment of text, positioning and tables were also added. Margin, padding, border and positioning for elements was also implemented. This recommendation was not maintained by W3C.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <STRONG>CSS2</STRONG>
                    <UL>
                        <li>CSS2 is the improvement of CSS1. It removed the not fully interoperable features. It also included the browser extensions.</li><br>
                        <li>It had many new features such as absolute, relative and fixed positioning of elements. It supported different media types. It also included new font properties such as shadow.</li>
                    </UL>
                    </p>
                <p> 
                    <strong>CSS3</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CSS3 is the most recent and currently used. It has XHTML specification. CSS3 has its major focus on modularisation and separation of concerns.</li><br>
                        <li>Different modules now go through different stages of the recommendation process. CSS3 has support for almost all recent web browsers.</li><br>
                        <li>It has even included new selectors along with new combinator and new pseudo-elements.</li><br>
                        <li>CSS3 has several new CSS properties. It supports animation which is not a part of earlier recommendations.</li><br>
                        <li>There were various properties added such as transforms, gradients, animation and transition for animation effect in the website.
                            Recent add-ons are like border-radius, box-shadow, flex-box and CSS grid.</li>
